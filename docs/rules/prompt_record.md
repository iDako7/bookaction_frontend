### finish migration task

You are my coding copilot. Finish the Next.js migration tasks in tasks/tasks-nextjs-migration.md while preserving UI/UX parity with the existing Vite front-end. Use docs/PRD.md and the current src/ screens/components/styles as the visual and interaction source of truth—no redesigns. Before coding, restate the goal and list the next unchecked tasks. As you work, update tasks/tasks-nextjs-migration.md checkboxes. Mirror layout, spacing, typography, colors, and flows exactly; compare against current pages. Ask for confirmation if anything is ambiguous. After changes, summarize what you changed, files touched, and suggest follow-up tests.@tasks-nextjs-migration.md@PRD.md
