# API Design

_Last updated: 2025-02-14. Sample payloads were captured by running `docker exec -i bookaction_postgres psql -U postgres -d bookaction_local -t -A -c '<SQL>'` so every example mirrors the current seed data that Prisma Studio exposes on port 5555._

## Architecture Snapshot

- **Layered Flow:** HTTP requests enter the Express routers (`src/routes/*.ts`), move through controllers (e.g., `ModuleController`, `ConceptController`), and are delegated to services (`ModuleService`, `ConceptService`, `UserProgressService`). Services isolate business rules and orchestrate repository calls (`ModuleRepository`, `ConceptRepository`, `UserProgressRepository`). Repositories wrap Prisma to talk to PostgreSQL.
- **DTO-first Contracts:** Request DTOs such as `UpdateProgressDTO` and response DTOs like `ConceptTutorialDTO`, `ConceptQuizzesDTO`, and `ModulesOverviewDTO` keep API shapes consistent and prevent leaking Prisma models to the client.
- **Dependency Injection:** Routes manually compose repositories → services → controllers, which keeps components testable and lets us plug in mock repositories or SQL-backed snapshots without touching application code.
- **Error Boundaries:** Controllers validate path/body parameters and surface user-friendly status codes, while services throw descriptive errors when dependent data (theme, quiz, summary, reflection) is missing.

### Component Overview

| Layer      | Responsibilities                                   | Key Files                                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Router     | Mounts HTTP paths                                  | `src/routes/module.routes.ts`, `src/routes/concept.routes.ts`                                                                 |
| Controller | Parse params, invoke services, serialize responses | `src/controller/ModuleController.ts`, `src/controller/ConceptController.ts`                                                   |
| Service    | Business logic, DTO shaping, orchestration         | `src/services/ModuleService.ts`, `src/services/ConceptService.ts`, `src/services/UserProgressService.ts`                      |
| Repository | Prisma queries + persistence helpers               | `src/repositories/ModuleRepository.ts`, `src/repositories/ConceptRepository.ts`, `src/repositories/UserProgressRepository.ts` |

## Critical Logic Highlights

### Modules Overview Aggregation

1. `ModuleRepository.returnModulesOverview(userId)` fetches modules ordered by `order_index`, includes the theme, and joins concept progress filtered to the requested user.
2. Repository logic calculates per-module completion by counting completed concepts vs. total, keeping the DTO lean.
3. `ModuleService.getModulesOverview` enforces defaults (userId 1 when missing) and remaps fields to the strict `ModulesOverviewDTO` before the controller returns it.

### Quiz Evaluation and Persistence

1. `ConceptController.saveUserQuizAns` validates `quizId`, `responseType`, `userId`, `userAnswerIndices`, and `timeSpent`.
2. `ConceptService.saveQuizAnswers` loads the canonical answers via `ConceptRepository.findQuizAnswer`, then feeds both arrays into `calculateScore`.
3. `calculateScore` handles single-choice (1 or 0) and multiple-choice (fraction of matches + strict correctness flag).
4. `ConceptRepository.saveQuizAnswersToDB` persists every submission to `user_response` JSONB for analytics.

### Reflection Capture

1. `ModuleController.getModuleReflection` fetches learner-facing prompts tied to a module, letting the UI show context-specific instructions.
2. `ModuleController.saveModuleReflection` enforces `reflectionId`, `userId`, and `answer`, then delegates to `ModuleService.saveModuleReflection`.
3. `ModuleRepository.saveModuleReflectionRes` stores responses in `user_response` with the `reflection` response type so later analytics can be grouped with quiz answers.

### Concept Progress Upsert

1. `ConceptController.updateConceptProgress` accepts `userId`, `isCompleted`, and optional `timeSpent`.
2. `UserProgressService.saveProgress` validates `userId` and calls `UserProgressRepository.upsertProgress`.
3. The repository uses Prisma's composite unique key (`concept_id_user_id`) to update or create progress, stamping `completed_at` when `isCompleted` is true.

## API Reference

_All sample responses below were produced from `docker exec -i bookaction_postgres psql ...` snapshots of the live seed database so they reflect the actual content surfaced in Prisma Studio._

### GET /api/modules/overview — Learning Homepage

- **Purpose:** Return every module with its theme, user-specific progress, and ordered concepts.
- **Request:** `GET /api/modules/overview`

## Appendix: Reproducing Samples

- Run `docker exec -i bookaction_postgres psql -U postgres -d bookaction_local -t -A -c '<SQL>'` and paste the SQL snippets included above (for example, the modules overview CTE or the concept-specific `jsonb_build_object` queries) to dump the latest seed data as JSON.
- The SQL was executed after `docker-compose up -d` started Postgres and the `prisma/seed/module1.json` content was synced into `Quiz.correct_option_index`, ensuring every payload mirrors what Prisma Studio displays on http://localhost:5555.
